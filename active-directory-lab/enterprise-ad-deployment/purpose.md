# Summary
The purpose of this lab is to setup a new AD forest, join a PC to the domain, and apply security controls to align with best security practices within an enterprise AD environment. For the purpose of this lab, I've chose to align with DISA STIG to simulate a government AD environment. 

# Technology utilized
This is a small lab to demonstrate proficiency of Active Directory administration. These systems are installed on an ESXi hypervisor running on their own vSwitch to isolate the typology from other devices. 

The following VMs were setup on the ESXi server:
1. Windows Server 2022. 
2. Windows 10 Pro.

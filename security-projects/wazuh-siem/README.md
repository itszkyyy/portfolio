# Summary
This project follows the install of Wazuh, an open-source SIEM solution, on Red Hat Enterprise Linux so I may have a security dashboard to have an overview of the lab environment. Logging allows me to be aware of security or server issues that may arise so I may promptly remediate the problem. 

# Environment
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux running bare-metal on server.
- Internet connection to download setup file.
